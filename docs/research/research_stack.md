# Research Stack

## Research Prompt Pack

1. "Define a practical taxonomy for Risk, Resilience, Response Readiness, and Recovery Capacity indices for disaster decision support."
2. "Propose measurable indicators for each index with formula, unit, directionality, and expected update cadence."
3. "Separate indicators into leading, coincident, and lagging categories and explain operational use."
4. "Design flood-specific index components using NOAA water level + NWS alerts + USGS hydrology."
5. "Design earthquake-specific index components using USGS events + vulnerability layers."
6. "Design social vulnerability factors (age, disability, income, housing, language, transport access) with weights and caveats."
7. "Design critical infrastructure continuity factors for hospitals, power, water, telecom, roads, ports, airports, and emergency facilities."
8. "Compare index-construction methods: weighted sum, AHP, PCA, Bayesian, MCDA. Recommend one baseline and one advanced path."
9. "Provide uncertainty handling strategy (missing data, delayed feeds, noisy sensors, confidence scoring)."
10. "Propose threshold bands (green/yellow/orange/red) for pre-event readiness and during-event escalation."
11. "Design a station-level and municipio-level scoring architecture and how to aggregate between scales."
12. "Give a reproducible method for dynamic weighting that shifts pre-event vs during-event vs post-event."
13. "Define response performance indicators (dispatch time, accessibility, shelter reach, route reliability, utility restoration priority)."
14. "Define recovery indicators (service restoration velocity, housing habitability, healthcare access restoration, school reopening, economic recovery proxies)."
15. "Provide validation/backtesting framework using historical Puerto Rico hazard events and known outcomes."
16. "Give fairness and equity checks so the model does not under-prioritize vulnerable communities."
17. "Provide explainability templates for stakeholders: why a zone scored high risk and what actions are recommended."
18. "Recommend map and dashboard visual encodings for emergency managers under time pressure."
19. "Create data quality/provenance scoring rubric for each source and how it affects index confidence."
20. "Propose a semester implementation roadmap: baseline MVP, validation milestone, and advanced extension."
